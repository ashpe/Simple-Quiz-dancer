create moose attribute start_time and end_time;

has 'end_time', is => 'rw', isa => 'Any';

$self->start_time(Benchmark->new);
$self->end_time(Benchmark->new);

my $time_taken = timediff($self->start_time, $self->end_time);
say "Time taken: " timestr($time_taken);

Difficulty settings, custom settings. Work out formula for specifying the amount of characters allowed out of place considering how many letters are in the word. Custom setting allows specifying the number manually, for all cases. Easy/Medium/Exact are the other difficulties otherwise.
